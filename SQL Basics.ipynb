    "## What is Data?\n",
    "The building block of databases is data. And data is simply information. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Database?\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is easily retrievable. A database can be hand written or electronic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Brief History of Relational Databases\n",
    "In 1970, Edgar Codd an IBM employee, being unhappy with the current heirarchical databases, wrote a series of papers describing a 'Relational Model'. This model described **entities** or tables that housed data for different types of data. For example, a grocery store capturing transactions could have different entities(tables) for the store, customer, product and employee. Each of these tables would contain **attributes** or columns such as store name, store address and store phone number (for the store table). Each table would also contain a **key** that would uniquely identify each **record** or row and allow for easy access to any particular row. The key also makes relating entities together straight-forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL - or Structured Query Language was also developed by IBM at the time to query data from these relational databases but it was actually Oracle in 1978 who released the first commericial RDBMS - relational database management system. Since then many different RDBMS have come to market with Oracle, and Mircorsoft SQL Server dominating the commercial market and MySQL and PostgreSQL leading in open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which SQL to use?\n",
    "Oracle, Mircosoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and all other RDBMS implement the SQL programming language in their own way. SQL actually became standardized by the American National Standards Institute and so most RDBMS will have very similar SQL commands. When learning SQL for the first time, its not very important which flavor you choose as the basic queries will look for the most part identical. Each language does provide a host of non-standard functions that will generally be named differently but again, most of the basic functionality can be replicated across the different vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Design\n",
    "While our primary concern in this notebook is on querying databases, it's nice to visualize tables in the relational model. These visualizations are called **entity relationship** diagrams and are very powerful ways of understanding how the data is related and can help immensely before beginning your queries. ![Movie EER](images/movie_eer.png)"

    "# MySQL Installation\n",

    "1. Navigate to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ and Click the first link (MySQL Community Server)\n",

    "1. Open .bash_profile with a text editor and add the line **export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH** to it\n",
    "1. Back in your home directory in your terminal, reload the bash profile by running the following command **. ~/.bash_profile**\n",
    "1. Continuing in your terminal, start mysql by running command **mysql -u root -p**\n",
    "1. If the above command doesn't work, open up system preferences by clicking the apple in the top left hand corner of the screen and clicking the MySQL icon on the bottom row and make sure the server is **running**\n",
    "1. Enter in your temporary password from step 5\n",
    "1. change your password by running the following command **SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('your_new_password');**\n",
    "1. You should be all set. You can run your frist sql command **SHOW DATABASES;** which should return a table of all the default databaes\n",

    "SQL is a high-level, easy to write, declarative language for accessing and manipulating data in a relational database management system. It's high-level and easy to write because it uses common english language without complex syntax and many powerful commands can be learned in a relatively short amount of time. Declarative means that you merely specificy the logic of what is desired and the sql interpreter will optimize the execution of the program. The program is not run top to bottom as in a procedural language. This is all figured out behind the scenes without your input.\n",
